# Frontrunners 2025: A Developer’s Guide to Open Source Web Mapping Libraries

This repository hosts the slide deck and a collection of interactive demos for my talk on building dynamic, visually appealing web maps using **Leaflet** and **MapLibre GL JS**.

## What’s Inside

- **Slides:** The complete [slide deck](https://github.com/cyatteau/frontrunners25-open-source-mapping/blob/main/Slides.pdf) for the presentation.
- **Demos:** A set of CodePen demos showcasing both Leaflet (and Esri Leaflet) and MapLibre GL JS examples:
  - Leaflet demos (e.g., simple maps, GeoJSON layers, feature layers, geosearch, and Places Service)
  - MapLibre GL JS demos (e.g., simple map with styles, feature layers with pagination and querying, vector tile layers, and Places basemap + Places service)
  
Check out the live demos here:  
[CodePen Demos Collection](https://codepen.io/collection/EPVyZx)

## Prerequisites

- **ArcGIS API Key:**  
  Needed for accessing ArcGIS services in some demos. Quickly sign up and create your own key at [location.arcgis.com](https://location.arcgis.com).

- **MapTiler Key:**  
  Required for the Places Basemap + Places Service demo. Sign up and get your key at [MapTiler Cloud](https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/).

## About the Talk

This presentation is aimed at developers new to GIS and covers:
- Key geospatial concepts (basemaps, data layers, geocoding)
- Hands-on demos with Leaflet and Esri Leaflet for lightweight, easy-to-use mapping
- Advanced WebGL-based mapping with MapLibre GL JS for high-performance, dynamic visualizations

## Getting Started

1. Open the slide deck to follow along with the presentation.
2. Explore the interactive demos on CodePen and insert your ArcGIS and MapTiler keys where needed.
3. Enjoy and feel free to share your feedback or ask any questions!
